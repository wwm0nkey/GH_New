The Example scene contains a simple demonstration of connecting using NAT Traversal.
Unity's matchmaking is used, and the first match that is found is joined.
By default all connection methods are enabled but if you want to test the punchthrough
specifically you can disable relay and direct connections. 

Instructions:
	1. Build and press the "Host" button to host
	2. Run in the editor and press the "Join" button to join
	3. Use the arrow keys to move the whales around.

Check out the ExampleNetworkManager.cs script to see how it all works.
